--
-- This module provides bindings to the Ed25519 public-key signature
-- system, including detached signatures. The documentation should be
-- self explanatory with complete examples.
--
-- Below the basic documentation you'll find API, performance and
-- security notes, which you may want to read carefully before
-- continuing. (Nonetheless, Ed25519 is one of the easiest-to-use
-- signature systems around, and is simple to get started with for
-- building more complex protocols. But the below details are highly
-- educational and should help adjust your expectations properly.)
--
-- For more reading on the underlying implementation and theory
-- (including how to get a copy of the original Ed25519 software),
-- visit <https://ed25519.cr.yp.to>. There are two papers that discuss
-- the design of EdDSA/Ed25519 in detail:
--
--   * <https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf "High-speed high-security signatures"> -
--   The original specification by Bernstein, Duif, Lange, Schwabe,
--   and Yang.
--
--   * <https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/eddsa-20150704.pdf "EdDSA for more curves"> -
--   An extension of the original EdDSA specification allowing it to
--   be used with more curves (such as Ed41417, or Ed488), as well as
--   defining the support for __message prehashing__. The original
--   EdDSA is easily derived from the extended version through a few
--   parameter defaults.
--
-- This package (and its documentation) won't consider non-Ed25519
-- EdDSA systems any further. Support for protocols like Ed448 may be
-- considered in the future.

-- Key creation

-- $creatingkeys
--
-- Ed25519 signatures start off life by having a keypair created,
-- using @'createKeypair'@ or @'createKeypairFromSeed_'@, which gives
-- you back a @'SecretKey'@ you can use for signing messages, and a
-- @'PublicKey'@ your users can use to verify you in fact authored the
-- messages.
--
-- Ed25519 is a /deterministic signature system/, meaning that you may
-- always recompute a @'PublicKey'@ and a @'SecretKey'@ from an
-- initial, 32-byte input seed. Despite that, the default interface
-- almost all clients will wish to use is simply @'createKeypair'@,
-- which uses an Operating System provided source of secure randomness
-- to seed key creation. (For more information, see the security notes
-- at the bottom of this page.)

-- Documentation and notes

-- $intro
--
-- The simplest use of this library is one where you probably need to
-- sign short messages, so they can be verified independently. That's
-- easily done by first creating a keypair with @'createKeypair'@, and
-- using @'sign'@ to create a signed message. Then, you can distribute
-- your public key and the signed message, and any recipient can
-- verify that message:
--
-- >>> (pk, sk) <- createKeypair
-- >>> let msg = sign sk "Hello world"
-- >>> verify pk msg
-- True
--
-- This interface is fine if your messages are small and simple binary
-- blobs you want to verify in an opaque manner, but internally it
-- creates a copy of the input message. Often, you'll want the
-- signature independently of the message, and that can be done with
-- @'dsign'@ and @'dverify'@. Naturally, verification fails if the
-- message is incorrect:
--
-- >>> (pk, sk) <- createKeypair
-- >>> let msg = "Hello world" :: ByteString
-- >>> let sig = dsign sk msg
-- >>> dverify pk msg sig
-- True
-- >>> dverify pk "Hello world" sig
-- True
-- >>> dverify pk "Goodbye world" sig
-- False
--
-- Finally, it's worth keeping in mind this package doesn't expose any
-- kind of incremental interface, and signing/verification can be
-- expensive. So, if you're dealing with __large inputs__, you can
-- hash the input with a robust, fast cryptographic hash, and then
-- sign that (for example, the @hash@ function below could be
-- __SHA-512__ or __BLAKE2b__):
--
-- >>> (pk, sk) <- createKeypair
-- >>> msg <- readBigFile "blob.tar.gz" :: IO ByteString
-- >>> let sig = dsign sk (hash msg)
-- >>> dverify pk (hash msg) sig
-- True
--
-- See the notes at the bottom of this module for more on message
-- prehashing (as it acts slightly differently in an EdDSA system).

-- $security
--
-- Included below are some notes on the security aspects of the
-- Ed25519 signature system, its implementation and design, this
-- package, and suggestions for how you might use it properly.



-- $background
--
-- Ed25519 is a specific instantiation of the __EdDSA__ digital
-- signature scheme - a high performance, secure-by-design variant of
-- Schnorr signatures based on "Twisted Edwards Curves" (hence the
-- name __Ed__DSA). The (__extended__) EdDSA system is defined by an
-- elliptic curve:
--
-- > ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + d*x^2*y^2
--
-- along with several other parameters, chosen by the implementation
-- in question. These parameters include @a@, @d@, and a field @GF(p)@
-- where @p@ is prime. Ed25519 specifically uses @d = -121665/121666@,
-- @a = -1@, and the finite field @GF((2^255)-19)@, where @(2^255)-19@
-- is a prime number (which is also the namesake of the algorithm in
-- question, as Ed__25519__). This yields the equation:
--

-- This curve is \'birationally equivalent\' to the well-known
-- Montgomery curve \'Curve25519\', a popular diffie hellman function
-- with strong security guarantees. Ed25519 is currently the
-- recommended EdDSA curve for most deployments (although newer
-- implementations such as Ed448 offer higher security at slower
-- speeds).
--
-- As Ed25519 is an elliptic curve algorithm, the security level
-- (i.e. number of computations taken to find a solution to the ECDLP
-- with the fastest known attacks) is roughly half the key size in
-- bits, as it stands. As Ed25519 features 32-byte keys, the security
-- level of Ed25519 is thus @2^((32*8)/2) = 2^128@, far beyond any
-- attacker capability (modulo major breakthroughs for the ECDLP,
-- which would likely catastrophically be applicable to other systems
-- too).
--
-- Ed25519 designed to meet the standard notion of unforgeability for
-- a public-key signature scheme under chosen-message attacks. This
-- means that even should the attacker be able to request someone sign
-- any arbitrary message of their choice (hence /chosen-message/),
-- they are still not capable of any forgery what-so-ever, even the
-- weakest kind of \'existential forgery\'.


-- $seedgen
--
-- Seed generation as done by @'createKeypair'@ uses Operating System
-- provided APIs for generating cryptographically secure psuedo-random
-- data to be used as an Ed25519 key seed. Your own deterministic keys
-- may be generated using @'createKeypairFromSeed_'@, provided you have
-- your own cryptographically secure psuedo-random data from
-- somewhere.
--
-- On __Linux__, __OS X__ and __other Unix__ machines, the
-- @\/dev\/urandom@ device is consulted internally in order to generate
-- random data. In the current implementation, a global file
-- descriptor is used through the lifetime of the program to
-- periodically get psuedo-random data.
--
-- On __Windows__, the @CryptGenRandom@ API is used internally. This
-- does not require file handles of any kind, and should work on all
-- versions of Windows. (Windows may instead use @RtlGenRandom@ in the
-- future for even less overhead.)
--
-- In the future, there are plans for this package to internally take
-- advantage of better APIs when they are available; for example, on
-- Linux 3.17 and above, @getrandom(2)@ provides psuedo-random data
-- directly through the internal pool provided by @\/dev\/urandom@,
-- without a file descriptor. Similarly, OpenBSD provides the
-- @arc4random(3)@ family of functions, which internally uses a data
-- generator based on ChaCha20. These should offer somewhat better
-- efficiency, and also avoid file-descriptor exhaustion attacks which
-- could lead to denial of service in some scenarios.


-- $keyverif
--
-- When using Ed25519, you may come across cases where you want to serialize a
-- @'PublicKey'@ (in a database, on disk, over the network) or otherwise put a
-- public key in a \"stable\" format, so you can read it later, and ensure it is
-- valid before computing signatures. Similarly, you may want to do the same for
-- signatures.
--
-- In order to do this, all you need to do is take the @'S.ByteString'@ out of
-- the data type, and write it to disk. That's all. There are no instances for
-- @binary@ or other packages; the @'S.ByteString'@ is the format, all on its
-- own.
--
-- This may seem mildly confusing at first; in most cases, you think of a public
-- key as something like \"the @id_rsa.pub@ file in my home directory\", but
-- that is not what a public key is. Rather, that is an __encoding__ of a public
-- key, in ASCII format. This ASCII format lends itself to a few features; for
-- example, it can encode multiple public key formats, or different key sizes.
-- Essentially, you can attach metadata into the ASCII representation.
--
-- Ed25519 has been designed carefully so that all 32-byte values are legitimate
-- keys. There are no illegitimate values for keys in this input space; all are
-- equally valid, and there is no bias or seed that is more legitimate than
-- another (other than entropy concerns).
--
-- Furthermore, Ed25519 has only one failure mode: either a signature is valid
-- under a particular public key, or it is not. Because signatures and keys can
-- be any arbitrary string of bytes, the only way to determine if a signature is
-- legitimate is to simply try to validate it against some key. Why do this? The
-- answer is: security. In practice, things like ASCII encoding formats require
-- a substantial amount of extra code on top of what is conceptually a simple
-- algorithm. Also, having multiple failure modes (\"public key is bad\",
-- \"signature was corrupted\" vs simply \"signature validation failed\")
-- requires even more code and tests to cover every case. This, in practice, can
-- cause security issues on its own (for example, if two code paths treat two
-- different failure mode the same due to copy and paste, or simple error, this
-- may lead to a security vulnerability).
--
-- With this in mind:
--
-- If you want to serialize Ed25519 public keys, private keys, or signatures in
-- this package, simply write out the @'S.ByteString'@ and do nothing else.
-- (These blobs are perfectly compatible with other Ed25519 libraries; it is an
-- __algorithm__, not a format, so they will compute the same results, and take
-- the same inputs.)
--
-- If you want to e.g. validate that a public key is legitimate -- simply demand
-- that the owner of the key sign something and give it to you. If the signature
-- is valid, then so is the key.
--
-- To repeat, __you should rarely have to worry about serialization issues__,
-- and this is a feature, not a bug (quite literally). Simply write out the
-- @'S.ByteString'@ blobs. If you would like self-describing \"ASCII Armored\"
-- formats like GnuPG -- you are free to implement this yourself, but you should
-- be careful about adding more code and surface area than you need, when
-- signature validation is already important enough.

-- $performance
--
-- Ed25519 is exceptionally fast, although the implementation provided
-- by this package is not the fastest possible implementation. Indeed,
-- it is rather slow, even by non-handwritten-assembly standards of
-- speed. That said, it should still be competitive with most other
-- signature schemes: the underlying implementation is @ref10@ from
-- <https://bench.cr.yp.to/ SUPERCOP>, authored by Daniel J. Bernstein,
-- which is within the
-- <https://bench.cr.yp.to/impl-sign/ed25519.html realm of competition>
-- against some assembly implementations (only 2x slower), and much
-- faster than the slow reference implementation (25x slower). When up
-- <https://bench.cr.yp.to/web-impl/amd64-skylake-crypto_sign.html against RSA>
-- signatures (ronald3072) on a modern Intel machine, it is still __15x__
-- faster at signing messages /at the same 128-bit security level/.

-- $keystorage
--
-- By default, keys are not encrypted in any meaningful manner with
-- any mechanism, and this package does not provide any means of doing
-- so. As a result, your secret keys are only as secure as the
-- computing environment housing them - a server alone out on the
-- hostile internet, or a USB stick that's susceptable to theft.
--
-- If you wish to add some security to your keys, a very simple and
-- effective way is __to add a password to your @'SecretKey'@ with a__
-- __KDF and a hash__. How does this work?
--
--   * First, hash the secret key you have generated. Use this as a
--   __checksum__ of the original key. Truncating this hash to save
--   space is acceptable; see below for more details and boring
--   hemming and hawing.
--
--   * Given an input password, use a KDF to stretch it to the length
--   of a @'SecretKey'@.
--
--   * XOR the @'SecretKey'@ bytewise, directly with the output of
--   your chosen KDF.
--
--   * Attach the checksum you generated to the resulting encrypted
--   key, and store it as you like.
--
-- In this mode, your key is XOR'd with the psuedo-random result of a
-- KDF, which will stretch simple passwords like "I am the robot" into
-- a suitable amount of psuedo-random data for a given secret key to
-- be encrypted with. Decryption is simply the act of taking the
-- password, generating the psuedo-random stream again, XORing the key
-- bytewise, and validating the checksum. In this sense, you are
-- simply using a KDF as a short stream cipher.
--
-- __Recommendation__: Encrypt keys by stretching a password with
-- __scrypt__ (or __yescrypt__), using better-than-default parameters.
-- (These being @N = 2^14@, @r = 8@, @p = 1@; the default results in
-- 16mb of memory per invocation, and this is the recommended default
-- for 'interactive systems'; signing keys may be loaded on-startup
-- for some things however, so it may be profitable to increase
-- security as well as memory use in these cases. For example, at @N =
-- 2^18@, @r = 10@ and @p = 2@, you'll get 320mb of memory per use,
-- which may be acceptable for dramatic security increases. See
-- elsewhere for exact memory use.) Checksums may be computed with an
-- exceptionally fast hash such as __BLAKE2b__.
--
-- __Bonus points__: Print that resulting checksum + key out on a
-- piece of paper (~100 bytes, tops), and put /that/ somewhere safe.
--
-- __Q__: What is the hash needed for? __A__: A simple file integrity
-- check. Rather than invoke complicated methods of verifying if an
-- ed25519 keypair is valid (as it is simply an opaque binary blob,
-- for all intents and purposes), especially after 'streaming
-- decryption', it's far easier to simply compute and compare against
-- a checksum of the original to determine if decryption with your
-- password worked.
--
-- __Q__: Wait, why is it OK to truncate the hash here? That sounds
-- scary. Won't that open up collisions or something like that if they
-- stole my encrypted key?  __A__: No. The hash in this case is only
-- used as a checksum to see if the password is legitimate after
-- running the KDF and XORing with the result. Think about how the
-- \'challenge\' itself is chosen: if you know @H(m)@, do you want to
-- find @m@ itself, or simply find @m'@ where @H(m') = H(m)@?  To
-- forge a signature, you want the original key, @m@. Suppose given an
-- input of 256-bits, we hashed it and truncated to one bit. Finding
-- collisions would be easy: you would only need to try a few times to
-- find a collision or preimage. But you probably found @m'@ such that
-- @H(m') = H(m)@ - you didn't necessarily find @m@ itself. In this
-- sense, finding collisions or preimages of the hash is not useful to
-- the attacker, because you must find the unique @m@.
--
-- __Q__: Okay, why use hashes at all? Why not CRC32? __A__: You could
-- do that, it wouldn't change much. You can really use any kind of
-- error detecting code you want. The thing is, some hashes such as
-- __BLAKE2__ are very fast in things like software (not every CPU has
-- CRC instructions, not all software uses CRC instructions), and
-- you're likely to already have a fast, modern hash function sitting
-- around anyway if you're signing stuff with Ed25519. Why not use it?



-- $prehashing
--
-- __Message prehashing__ (although not an official term in any right)
-- is the idea of first taking an input @x@, using a
-- __cryptographically secure__ hash function @H@ to calculate @y =
-- H(x)@, and then generating a signature via @Sign(secretKey,
-- y)@. The idea is that signing is often expensive, while hashing is
-- often extremely fast. As a result, signing the hash of a message
-- (which should be indistinguishable from a truly random function) is
-- often faster than simply signing the full message alone, and in
-- larger cases can save a significant amount of CPU cycles. However,
-- internally Ed25519 uses a hash function @H@ already to hash the
-- input message for computing the signature. Thus, there is a
-- question - is it appropriate or desireable to hash the input
-- already if this is the case?
--
-- Generally speaking, it's OK to prehash messages before giving them
-- to Ed25519. However, there is a caveat. In the paper
-- <https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/eddsa-20150704.pdf "EdDSA for more curves">,
-- the authors of the original EdDSA enhance the specification by
-- extending it with a message prehash function, @H'@, along with an
-- internal hash @H@. Here, the prehash @H'@ is simply applied to the
-- original message first before anything else. The original EdDSA
-- specification (and the implementation in /this package/) was a
-- trivial case of this enhancement: it was implicit that @H'@ is
-- simply the identity function. We call the case where @H'@ is the
-- identity function __PureEdDSA__, while the case where @H'@ is a
-- cryptographic hash function is known as __HashEdDSA__. (Thus, the
-- interfaces @'sign'@ and @'dsign'@ implement PureEdDSA - while they can
-- be converted to HashEdDSA by simply hashing the @'ByteString'@
-- first with some other function.)
--
-- However, the authors note that HashEdDSA suffers from a weakness
-- that PureEdDSA does not - PureEdDSA is resiliant to collision
-- attacks in the underlying hash function @H@, while HashEdDSA is
-- vulnerable to collisions in @H'@. This is an important
-- distinction. Assume that the attacker finds a collision such that
-- @H'(x) = H'(y)@, and then gets convinces a signer to HashEdDSA-sign
-- @x@ - the attacker may then forge this signature and use it as the
-- same signature as for the message @y@. For a hash function of
-- @N@-bits of output, a collision attack takes roughly @2^(N/2)@
-- operations.
--
-- Ed25519 internally sets @H = SHA-512@ anyway, which has no known
-- collision attacks or weaknesses in any meaningful sense. It is
-- however slower compared to other, more modern hash functions, and
-- is used on the input message in its entirety (and there are no
-- plans to switch the internal implementation of this package, or the
-- standard Ed25519 away from @H = SHA-512@).
--
-- But note: /all other hash-then-sign constructions suffer from/
-- /this/, in the sense they are all vulnerable to collision attacks
-- in @H'@, should you prehash the message. In fact, PureEdDSA is
-- unique (as far as I am aware) in that it is immune to collision
-- attacks in @H@ - should a collision be found, it would not suffer
-- from these forgeries. By this view, it's arguable that /depending/
-- on the HashEdDSA construction (for efficiency or size purposes)
-- when using EdDSA is somewhat less robust, even if SHA-512 or
-- whatever is not very fast. Despite that, just about any /modern/
-- /hash/ you pick is going to be collision resistant to a fine degree
-- (say, 256 bits of output, therefore collisions 'at best' happen in
-- @2^128@ operations), so in practice this robustness issue may not
-- be that big of a deal.
--
-- However, the more pertinent issue is that due to the current design
-- of the API which requires the entire blob to sign up front, using
-- the HashEdDSA construction is often much more convenient, faster
-- and sometimes /necessary/ too. For example, when signing very large
-- messages (such as creating a very large @tar.gz@ file which you
-- wish to sign after creation), it is often convenient and possible
-- to use \'incremental\' hashing APIs to incrementally consume data
-- blocks from the input in a constant amount of memory. At the end of
-- consumption, you can \'finalize\' the data blocks and get back a
-- final N-bit hash, and sign this hash all in a constant amount of
-- memory. With the current API, using PureDSA would require you
-- loading the entire file up front to either sign, or verify it. This
-- is especially unoptimal for possibly smaller, low-memory systems
-- (where decompression, hashing or verification are all best done in
-- constant space if possible).
--
-- Beware however, that if you do this sort of incremental hashing for
-- large blobs, you are __taking untrusted data__ and hashing it
-- __before checking the signature__ - be __exceptionally careful__
-- with data from a possibly untrustworthy source until you can verify
-- the signature.
--
-- So, some basic guidelines are:
--
--   - If you are simply not worried about efficiency very much, just
--   use __PureEdDSA__ (i.e.  just use @'sign'@ and @'verify'@
--   directly). It's simple and easy.
--
--   - If you have lots of small messages, use __PureEdDSA__ (i.e.
--   just use @'sign'@ and @'verify'@ directly). It's simple and easy.
--
--   - If you have to sign/verify __large messages__, possibly __in__
--   __an incremental fashion__, use __HashEdDSA__ with a fast
--   hash (i.e.  just hash a message before using @'sign'@ or
--   @'verify'@ on it).
--
--       - A hash like __BLAKE2b__ is recommended. Fast and very secure.
--
--       - Remember: __never touch input data in any form until you__
--       __are done hashing it and verifying the signature__.
--
-- As a result, you should be safe hashing your input before passing
-- it to @'sign'@ or @'dsign'@ in this library if you desire, and it
-- may save you CPU cycles for large inputs. It should be no different
-- than the typical /hash-then-sign/ construction you see elsewhere,
-- with the same downfalls. Should you do this, an extremely
-- fast-yet-secure hash such as __BLAKE2b__ is recommended, which is
-- even faster than MD5 or SHA-1 (and __do not ever use MD5 or__
-- __SHA-1__, on that note - MD5 and both SHA1 are weak comparatively
-- to modern ciphers, and have many published attacks that are getting
-- better).
